# Kyla Interview App

## Overview

This project is a Flutter application built with a focus on state management, responsive design, and clean architecture. It utilizes several essential libraries and design patterns to create a smooth and scalable experience for both developers and users.

## Features

- **State Management with GetX:**  
  Efficient state management is handled using the [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) package, which allows for simple and reactive state updates, dependency injection, and navigation without unnecessary boilerplate.

- **Responsive Design with ScreenUtil:**  
  The [Flutter ScreenUtil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) library ensures the app maintains a consistent and responsive layout across different screen sizes and resolutions. With this, the app adapts seamlessly to any device.

- **Singleton Pattern for Custom Components:**  
  Custom components are implemented using the Singleton Design Pattern, ensuring efficient memory usage and a single point of access across the app.

- **Routing:**  
  A structured and efficient routing system is implemented, making navigation between screens fluid and maintainable. Routes are managed in a way that supports both named routes and dynamic parameters.

- **Detailed Theme Management:**  
  The app features a comprehensive theme management system, allowing for easy customization and dark/light mode support. Theme settings are centralized, making global changes simple and effective.
